I really like the programming behind Infinity Responder, plus it just works!
It still stands up against some pretty great autoresponder software and it's free.
So I've adapted it and ported it to be a Wordpress plugin. :-)

ALL FUTURE CHANGES FROM 1.3.0 TO BE RECORDED IN readme.txt


----------------------------------------------------------
Infinity Responder to WP Infinity Responder Port Changelog
----------------------------------------------------------

General Bugfixes and Updates for Infinity Responder 0.9b
--------------------------------------------------------

Added some new responder dashboard images (settings.gif, users.gif and form_gen.gif)
Changed the trash_del.gif image to fit better with other images.

Referral Source and IP Bugfix
Insert after Line 238 of sendmails.php
	$DB_ReferralSource  = $this_subscriber['ReferralSource'];
	$DB_IPaddy          = $this_subscriber['IP_Addy'];
	
File: admin.php Found and commented out
	include('templates/resplist_top.admin.php');

Why send out a subscription confirmation every time when you can say this in your first
autoresponder message..? (Note: This could be a future optional per responder setting.)
Commented out Lines 216 and 502 of s.php 
 SendMessageTemplate('templates/subscribe.complete.txt');

Added option to send confirmation email for Add Subscribers and Bulk Add pages.
Added option to import first name, last name, subscriber IP and referral source in Bulk Add.
